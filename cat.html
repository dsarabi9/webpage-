It was believed that they bring good luck to the people who housed them in Ancient Egypt. To honor the cats, the wealthy people dressed them in jewels and gave them treats that were for royalty. When the cats died, they were mummified, and sometimes with the pharaohs. Cats in Ancient Egypt symbolised the power of the Gods. They even believed that one of them was a goddess of lower Egypt, she was protective and could bring great prosperity. People worshiped cats back in the day, Especially in Ancient Egypt.
