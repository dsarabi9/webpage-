<p style="background-color:White;">Cats are one of the most amazing creatures on this earth. They come in all shapes, sizes and colours! Cats are part of the Mammal community. On average, they live up to 12-18 years. The oldest domestic cat reported was called Creme puff, she lived up to 38 years old. Outdoor cats usually have shorter lives, as they are more in danger. Cats love eating meat as they are carnivores. They like to eat cooked beef, chicken, and turkey.</p>

All cats are hunters, they don't rely on anyone for food. Cats in the wild have to hunt every meal for their family. Cats claws are sharp and retractable. All cats have excellent night vision. Their whiskers are very important, without them they can't walk straight or balance because they detect surroundings and objects. Cats can jump several times their hight.
